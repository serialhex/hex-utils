# hex utils

This is a (hopefully smallish) utility library with various functions from
books, such as "On Lisp", "Let Over Lambda", "Land of Lisp" and a handful of
things I personally found helpful and thought would be nice in a library.

I know that there are a bunch of Lisp utility libraries out there, but this is
my own personal "Batman Utility Belt"!!
